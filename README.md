Food Delivery Company Sales Analytics using PowerBI

# Problem Statement
Your task is to create a **Power BI report** for a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. The report should help the fulfilment centres with demand forecasting for the upcoming weeks. The report should be based on three datasets: historical demand data for each product-center combination, product features such as category, sub-category, price, and discount, and information about the fulfilment centres such as location and city.

The report should answer the following questions posed by the sales director:

    1. Total number of orders with a date filter
    2. Revenue earned by the company
    3. Total discounted value and overall discount %
    4. Whether the business follows the Pareto principle
    5. Top 5 selling categories
    6. Influence of operational area on number of orders
    7. Effectiveness of email and product features as a mode of promotion
    8. Forecasted weekly quantity sold for each centre, city, and meal category for the next 5 weeks.

The report should be granular enough to include product information and center-meal combinations. The report should be visually appealing and interactive to allow the sales director to easily understand the level of demand for each centre and make informed decisions.
